In order to ease your interface development process, herewith we are forwarding all the relevant data with this mail as an attachment.



Please go through INTREPID SDK Brochure.pdf file which gives you a clear picture on two of our SDK i.e. RPM II SDK and IPP II SDK. Page 3 of this file shows RPM II as well as IPP II Example Configuration Diagram.

In order to support the application developers, SWM INC has online test platform ( without the need of any local hardware). For more information please refer following attached PDF files:

IPP II SDK Based Development:

The INTREPID™ Polling Protocol II (IPP II) Software Development Kit (SDK) is an application layer protocol developed by Southwest Microwave that provides a method for a third-party control or monitoring system to query status and send commands between individual INTREPID™ Series II sensors and auxiliary devices.  IPP II SDK requires external network device for TCP/IP access.
